This plugin automatically adds user-defined tags to posts.

== Description ==
With APT you won't have to manually add tags ever again. You just have to create a list of tags with related words for each of them and you are done. This plugin will add relevant tags automatically when a post is published or updated. It is perfect for autoblogs and lazy bloggers. :)

= Features = 
* Automatically adds tags to posts according to their title, content and excerpt
* Tags are added to a post also when different user-defined keywords are found (example: tag "cat" is added if you assign to it words "cats, kitty, meow" and they are found in a post by the plugin)
* Smart wildcard representation of any alphanumeric characters for related words (pattern "cat\*" will match "cats" and "category", pattern "c\*t" will match "cat" and "colt" etc.)
* Configurable maximum number of tags per post (APT won't add more tags than you want)
* Bulk tagging of already existing posts
* Workaround for Latin diacritic characters (non-Latin alphabets like Arabic or Chinese aren't supported)
* Supports importing already existing tags, creating and importing backups

== Installation ==
1. Upload the plugin to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate it through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Configure the plugin (Settings â†’ Automatic Post Tagger).

== Screenshots ==
1. Administration interface
2. Widget located under the post editor

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What happens after deleting the plugin? Will I have to remove its options etc. from my database? =
No. All plugin data will be automatically removed from your database after you delete the plugin via your administration interface.

= I get the "Maximum execution time of XY seconds exceeded" error when trying to assign tags to all posts. =
Delete all word separators and use the option "Replace non-alphanumeric characters with spaces" or try to assign less tags at once or let set the plugin to analyse less characters per post.

= I can't delete tags assigned by the plugin, it recreates them again! What should I do? =
If you are trying to delete tags from a published post you have to deactivate the plugin in order to delete tags.

= I got a warning message that saying that saved tag name/related words contain non-alphanumeric characters. What does that mean?  =
Your tag name or related words contain different characters than letters, numbers and asterisks. Your data were successfully saved into database but you may want to check the values again to make sure that you accidentally didn't make a typo. Non-alphanumeric characters in posts and your tags/related words are converted to spaces during searching for tags.

= Some tags can't be imported from my backup. Why? =
You are most likely trying to import records with duplicate tag names which are ignored by the plugin.

= ATP doesn't add tags even if they or their related words are in my post! =
This may happen if you put a PHP code in your post that doesn't have correct opening/closing tags (`<?php` and `?>`). You may want to check the option "Replace non-alphanumeric characters with spaces" if you are unable/unwilling to correct your code but you still want to analyze it. Also make sure that the option "Strip PHP/HTML tags from analysed content" is unchecked.

= APT doesn't add unusual tags to my posts, for example HTML tags like &lt;a&gt;. =
WordPress isn't able to do that, it just saves gibberish or an ampty string to the database.

= Which tag will be added if I want to add only one tag per post? =
The one that has the lowest ID (and was found in your post, of course).

= I have another problem that isn't described on this page and wasn't solved by reinstalling the plugin. =
Please post a new thread on the [support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/automatic-post-tagger).
